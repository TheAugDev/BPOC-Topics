    <!-- Chosen Palette: Slate & Red -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page application focused on firearms principles and safety. The structure is thematic and hierarchical, starting with universal safety rules, then moving to marksmanship fundamentals, weapon handling, tactics, and concluding with qualification standards and an interactive review. This logical progression is ideal for learning. Key interactions include prominent cards for safety rules, collapsible sections for detailed techniques to avoid information overload, and a quiz-style section for the review questions to promote active learning. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - General Safety Rules: Report Info -> A list of four core rules. Goal -> Emphasize critical safety principles. Viz -> Four distinct, heavily styled cards using a red accent color to denote importance. Justification -> High-visibility cards ensure these foundational rules are seen and remembered first.
        - Marksmanship/Manipulations/Tactics: Report Info -> Detailed text descriptions of various techniques. Goal -> Instruct on practical skills. Viz -> Collapsible 'details' sections for each topic (Stance, Grip, Reloads, Use of Cover, etc.). Justification -> This organizes a large amount of technical information into a clean, manageable interface, allowing users to focus on one topic at a time.
        - TCOLE Qualification Standards: Report Info -> Text describing requirements. Goal -> Inform on official standards. Viz -> A clear, easy-to-read HTML table. Justification -> A table is the most effective way to present structured data like weapon types, round counts, distances, and required scores.
        - Review Questions: Report Info -> Lists of questions and a word scramble. Goal -> Test knowledge. Viz -> An interactive quiz section where each question is on a card with a 'Reveal Answer' button. Interaction -> The user actively attempts to answer before seeing the correct response. Justification -> This active recall method is a highly effective study technique compared to passive reading.

            ],
            correct: 1,
            explanation: "Rule 1 is 'All guns are always loaded.' This fundamental rule ensures you treat every firearm as if it contains ammunition, preventing most accidents."

            ],
            correct: 2,

            correct: 1,

                "Cover hides you; concealment stops bullets",
                "Cover stops bullets; concealment only hides you",

            ],
            correct: 2,
            explanation: "Cover stops bullets (engine block, concrete wall), while concealment only hides you from view but won't stop rounds (bush, drywall). Always prioritize cover over concealment."

                "Only when ordered by a supervisor"
            ],
            correct: 1,
            explanation: "An Immediate Action Reload is performed when the slide locks back on an empty magazine. You drop the empty magazine while retrieving a fresh one."

            ],
            correct: 2,

            ],
            correct: 2,
