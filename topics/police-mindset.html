    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Blue & Gray with Amber accents -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page application focused on the cognitive and tactical aspects of policing. The structure is thematic, starting with the learning mindset, moving to decision-making models (WIN), exploring the psychology of performance (Imagery), and concluding with practical awareness tactics (SAFE model, Field Interviews). This progression helps build a strong conceptual foundation before moving to application. Key interactions include collapsible sections for detailed explanations and side-by-side comparisons for concepts like the two operational mindsets. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - The Learning Circle: Report Info -> A diagram about growth. Goal -> Explain the learning process. Viz -> A descriptive text block. Justification -> The concept is philosophical and best explained textually.
        - Critical Decision-Making Model (CDM): Report Info -> A spinning model diagram. Goal -> Instruct on a decision-making process. Viz -> A collapsible section breaking down the CDM's core and steps. Justification -> Allows for a focused explanation of this central model.
        - Officer Mindsets (Verbal Persuasion vs. Recognize-React): Report Info -> A comparison diagram. Goal -> Contrast two operational modes. Viz -> Two distinct, styled cards with bullet points. Justification -> Visually separates the two modes and the SAFE acronym, making the concept clear and easy to memorize.
        - The 4 Risk Zones: Report Info -> A diagram showing scan areas. Goal -> Teach situational awareness. Viz -> A descriptive list. Justification -> A simple, clear list is effective for memorizing the four key areas to scan.
