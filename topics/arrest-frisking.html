    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Blue & Gray with Amber accents -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page application focused solely on frisking. The structure is task-oriented: Legal Foundations (The 'Why'), Frisking Techniques (The 'How'), and Handling Finds (The 'What If'). This logical flow guides the user from theory to practice. Key interactions include collapsible sections for detailed procedures and key case law callouts to make critical information easily digestible and memorable. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Frisk Justification: Report Info -> Text explaining the need for articulable facts. Goal -> Inform & Emphasize. Viz -> Contrasting "Bad" vs. "Good" examples in styled cards. Justification -> Clearly demonstrates the difference between a conclusory statement and proper legal articulation.
        - Frisking Techniques: Report Info -> Images and text describing hand grips. Goal -> Instruct. Viz -> Side-by-side cards with bulleted lists for the two main techniques. Justification -> Organizes practical steps into a clear, comparable format.
        - Plain Feel Doctrine: Report Info -> Text on Minnesota v. Dickerson. Goal -> Explain a critical legal limit. Viz -> A prominent, highlighted block with a clear summary. Justification -> Makes this essential rule impossible to miss.
        - What to do if a weapon is found: Report Info -> List of considerations. Goal -> Guide decision-making. Viz -> Interactive collapsible sections for different weapon types. Interaction -> User clicks a weapon type to see the appropriate response protocol. Justification -> Encourages active thinking about different scenarios.

                <p class="mb-4">A frisk (or "pat down") is a limited search for weapons and is strictly governed by the 4th Amendment. Its sole purpose is <span class="font-semibold">officer safety</span>. Understanding when a frisk is justified is critical.</p>

                </div>

                <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-3">Articulating Your Justification</h3>
                <p class="text-sm mb-4">Simply stating "for officer safety" is not enough. You must be able to articulate the specific facts and circumstances that made you believe the person could be armed.</p>
