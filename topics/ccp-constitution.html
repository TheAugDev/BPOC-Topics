    <title>CCP & Constitution Interactive Study Guide</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Slate & Amber -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: This single-page application uses a fixed sidebar for thematic navigation, allowing users to easily switch between the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP), Constitutional Rights, and practical scenarios. This non-linear, dashboard-style approach is more effective for studying than a simple document conversion. Key interactions include collapsible sections for detailed lists (like 'Who are Peace Officers?') to improve readability, and an interactive quiz format for the practical scenarios where users can guess the offense before revealing the answer, which aids retention. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - CCP vs. PC Objectives: Report Info -> Two lists of objectives. Goal -> Compare. Viz -> Side-by-side comparison table using HTML/Tailwind. Justification -> Direct comparison in a table format makes the distinct goals of each code immediately clear.
        - List of Peace Officers: Report Info -> Long, single list. Goal -> Organize & Inform. Viz -> Collapsible 'details' sections. Justification -> Prevents overwhelming the user with a wall of text, making the information scannable and easier to digest.
        - Constitutional Amendments: Report Info -> Text describing rights. Goal -> Inform & Relate. Viz -> Styled cards for each amendment, cross-referencing Texas Constitution and CCP articles. Justification -> Organizes rights into distinct, memorable blocks and shows the relationship between federal and state law.
        - Practical Scenarios: Report Info -> Text scenarios with answers. Goal -> Test Knowledge. Viz -> Interactive quiz format with 'Reveal Answer' buttons. Interaction -> User actively engages by attempting to solve the scenario first. Justification -> Active recall is a more effective learning strategy than passive reading.
