    <title>Fitness & Wellness Interactive Guide</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Green & Gray with Blue accents -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page application focused on officer fitness and wellness. The structure is thematic, starting with foundational definitions, moving to practical exercise principles (FITT), then covering nutrition, and finally providing interactive self-assessment tools. This logical flow guides the user from knowledge to application. Key interactions include collapsible sections for detailed guidelines and interactive checklists for the PAR-Q and other self-assessments, making the content more engaging and personally relevant. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Fitness Components: Report Info -> Lists of fitness types. Goal -> Inform & Differentiate. Viz -> Two styled cards clearly separating "Health-Related" and "Motor" fitness components. Justification -> Visual separation helps clarify the two distinct but related categories.
        - FITT Guidelines: Report Info -> Text blocks for different training types. Goal -> Instruct. Viz -> A master collapsible section for FITT, with nested collapsible details for Cardiovascular, Strength, and Flexibility training. Justification -> This nested structure allows users to see the high-level concept and then drill down into specifics for each type of exercise without being overwhelmed.
        - Nutrition: Report Info -> Text on macronutrients and diet strategies. Goal -> Educate. Viz -> A combination of styled cards for different nutrients (Carbs, Protein, Fat) and a prominent "MyPlate" graphic. Justification -> Breaking down nutrients into individual cards makes the information digestible, while the MyPlate graphic provides a simple, memorable visual for building a healthy meal.
        - Self-Assessments: Report Info -> Static questionnaire forms. Goal -> Engage & Assess. Viz -> Interactive checklists using HTML and JavaScript. Interaction -> Users can click checkboxes to answer questions, and the score can be tallied dynamically. Justification -> Transforms a passive reading task into an active, engaging self-evaluation.

                <p class="mb-6">A safe, effective exercise program is built on several key principles. Before starting, it's crucial to determine your readiness, using a tool like the PAR-Q if necessary.</p>

                                <p>To improve, the body must be subjected to demands greater than normal daily activities. As the body adapts, the demand (intensity or duration) must be gradually increased.</p>

                                <p>An exercise program must be consistent. Fitness begins to decline after 96 hours of inactivity. Equally important is recovery; allow at least 48 hours between heavy exercises targeting the same muscle groups.</p>

                                <p>The body adapts specifically to the type of demand placed on it. Running builds cardiovascular endurance, while weight training builds strength. A program should be specific to your fitness goals.</p>
